# Methods

Every score is a **relative index from 0 to 100, not a probability**. Classes: 0–20 very low, 20–40 low, 40–60 moderate, 60–80 high, 80–100 very high. A missing input gives **no data (null), never 0**. All formulas live in `js/risk.js`, `js/fwi.js`, `js/flood_stats.js`; all thresholds in `js/config.js`.

## What is observed and what is modelled

| Layer | Nature | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Risk scores (all three hazards) | **Model forecast**, next 72 h (fire: today + 2 days) | Open-Meteo forecast, CAMS, GloFAS |
| Satellite imagery and overlays | **Observation**, previous day or earlier | NASA GIBS (MODIS, VIIRS, GPM IMERG, HLS) |
| Fire detections (optional) | **Observation**, last 3 days | NASA FIRMS (VIIRS, MODIS) |

The index is not computed *from* the satellite layers; they are shown beside it so a reader can compare. Computing risk directly from Sentinel/Landsat rasters needs Google Earth Engine or a server, see `ROADMAP.md`.

## Wildfire

Canadian Fire Weather Index System (Van Wagner 1987; Van Wagner and Pickett 1985): FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI. It is the basis of EFFIS, GWIS and the ECMWF GEFF forecast.

- Daily inputs at **12:00 local**: temperature, relative humidity, 10 m wind (km/h), precipitation over the 24 h ending at noon.
- Run from the first day of a **92-day history** (Open-Meteo `past_days` maximum) with start values FFMC 85, DMC 6, DC 15.
- Score: FWI mapped piecewise-linearly through the **EFFIS class limits** 0, 5.2, 11.2, 21.3, 38, 50 to scores 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 (EFFIS: very low < 5.2, low 5.2–11.2, moderate 11.2–21.3, high 21.3–38, very high 38–50, extreme ≥ 50; our top class merges very high and extreme).
- Snow depth ≥ 1 cm at noon sets the day's score to 0; the FWI is still shown.
- The point score is the maximum over today and the next 2 days.

**Verification.** `tests/fwi.test.mjs` reproduces the first-day reference values of the cffdrs R package test data (FFMC 87.692, DMC 8.545, DC 19.013, ISI 10.853, FWI 10.096). The same test found and fixed an error in our DC formula during development.

**Limits.** FWI measures weather-driven dryness only. It ignores fuel load, vegetation type, curing, terrain and human ignition. The 92-day spin-up from default start values can under-estimate DC and BUI late in a dry season. EFFIS classes were derived for Europe; Greek work (Tethys 2018) found them poorly discriminating there, so Mongolian use needs local calibration against burned-area or active-fire records.

## Dust storm

Score = max( CAMS term, emission-potential term ).

1. **CAMS term.** Modelled surface dust concentration (µg/m³, `dust` from the Open-Meteo air quality API, CAMS global, 0.4°), maximum over 72 h, mapped through breakpoints 0, 10, 45, 100, 250, 500 → 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100. 45 µg/m³ is the WHO 2021 24-h PM10 guideline, 100 the second interim target. Hourly dust is compared with a 24-h guideline only as a reference level.
2. **Emission potential.** For each hour in the next 72 h: wind factor = clamp((u₁₀ − 6)/(14 − 6), 0, 1), forced to 0 if snow depth ≥ 1 cm or the calendar day's precipitation ≥ 0.254 mm (US EPA AP-42 13.2.2 wet-day rule). Maximum over hours × 100, **capped at 79** so that potential alone cannot reach "very high": nothing says dust is actually in the air. The 6 m/s onset follows the lowest of the 6, 8 and 10 m/s dust-prone-day thresholds used by the reference project Buyja047/earth_trending (which cites US EPA AP-42 and Kurosaki and Mikami 2004, 2005, not re-checked here); 14 m/s as the "strong" end is a heuristic.

**Limits.** No soil texture, vegetation or surface-roughness data; Gobi dust sources and the Altai foothills differ. CAMS cells are ~45 km. A point score for an aimag centre may miss dust in the south of the aimag.

## Flood

Score = max( rain term, discharge term ), + 15 if rain falls on snow (snow depth ≥ 5 cm, rain ≥ 0.5 mm/h, T > 0 °C).

1. **Rain term.** Forecast liquid rain over the next 72 h. Maximum rolling 24-h total mapped through 0, 10, 25, 50, 80 mm → 0, 25, 50, 75, 100; maximum hourly rate mapped through 0, 5, 10, 20, 40 mm/h → same scores; the larger of the two.
2. **Discharge term.** GloFAS v4 river discharge (via Open-Meteo, 0.05°, "largest river in a 5 km area"): maximum over today + 10 days.
   - With **return levels** (`data/flood_thresholds.json`: Gumbel fit by L-moments to annual maxima of a 1990–2024 reanalysis, `scripts/build-flood-thresholds.mjs`): 0.25·Q2, Q2, Q5, Q20, 1.5·Q20 → 0, 40, 60, 80, 100.
   - Without them: rise factor = forecast max ÷ median of the previous 30 days, mapped 1.5, 2.5, 4, 8 → 0, 40, 70, 100, ignored if the forecast maximum is below 0.5 m³/s; flagged `no_return_levels` and shown as such.

**Limits.** Convective cloudbursts of 10–40 mm in 30 minutes, which cause Ulaanbaatar flash floods, are smoothed out by model grids. GloFAS snapping may pick a different river than the one near the aimag centre. Ice-jam floods are not modelled.

## Worst-case checks

1. **Missing data.** Unit tests with nulls scattered through every input array, and with entire APIs missing, give `null` or a flagged partial score, never a fabricated 0 (`tests/risk.test.mjs`, `tests/pipeline.test.mjs`).
2. **Extreme inputs.** 60 seeded random extreme weather states (−45 to +48 °C, 0–100 % RH, wind to 45 m/s, rain to 90 mm, discharge to 3000 m³/s): all scores finite and in 0–100.
3. **Monotonicity.** Dust score does not decrease with wind; FWI does not decrease with ISI or BUI; rain lowers all moisture codes.
4. **Threshold sensitivity** (`node scripts/sensitivity.mjs`, 150 seeded synthetic scenarios; only the *sensitivity* is meaningful, the class counts depend on the generator). Share of scenarios that change class when a threshold set is scaled:

| Hazard | Change | Scenarios changing class |
|---|---|---|
| fire | all FWI class limits ×0.8 / ×1.2 | 23 % / 21 % |
| dust | wind onset and strong ×0.8 / ×1.2 | 3 % / 4 % |
| dust | CAMS breakpoints ×0.8 / ×1.2 | 29 % / 45 % |
| flood | 24-h rain breakpoints ×0.8 / ×1.2 | 0 % / 1 % |
| flood | hourly rain breakpoints ×0.8 / ×1.2 | 0 % / 0 % |

Reading: class boundaries are fragile for fire and especially for the CAMS dust term. Read the **number**, not only the colour, and do not treat a one-class difference between two aimags as meaningful.

## Polygon risk tool (added 2026-11)

* The user draws a polygon. A regular lat/lon grid of at most 7 x 7 nodes covers its bounding box (spacing at least 0.1 degree, because the weather and CAMS models behind the scores are 0.1-0.4 degree).
* Every node gets the same three scores as a province point (Fire Weather Index, dust, flood) from Open-Meteo. The flood score at a node uses rainfall plus the river-discharge rise factor; the fitted return levels exist only for the 22 province points.
* Scores are interpolated bilinearly onto a pixel raster (up to 180 px on the long side) and coloured with the five hazard classes. **The pixel size is a display size, not a measurement size**: inside one model cell the colour changes only because of interpolation. For fine detail use the 30 m satellite layers.
* Worst case checked: a polygon smaller than one model cell gets almost one colour (correct, not a bug); a polygon covering all of Mongolia is capped at 49 nodes, so pixels are about 150 km apart in the node sense.

## Mine dust plume tool (added 2026-11)

* Wind: Open-Meteo hourly 10 m wind on a 7 x 7 grid (0.6 degree north-south, 0.8 degree east-west) around the source. Dates older than 85 days use the ERA5 archive, newer dates the forecast API (which holds the last 92 days and 16 days ahead).
* Transport: Lagrangian Gaussian puffs released every 3 minutes, moved by the interpolated wind.
* Spread: Briggs (1973) open-country neutral-air curve, sigma_y = 0.11 x / sqrt(1 + 0.0001 x), plus a 150 m source size. **Source conflict:** one retrieved copy of the table lists class D open-country as 0.08 x and the more common listing (Briggs 1973 as reproduced in textbooks) gives 0.11 x for D and 0.16 x for C; the urban D value of 0.16 agrees in both. This tool uses 0.11. The choice changes plume width by up to about 30 % (0.08 to 0.16 spans a factor 2 in the extremes) but not the direction or timing. The check that settles it is the primary source: Briggs, G.A. (1973), ATDL Contribution File No. 79.
* Settling: puff mass decays with a 6 h time constant (assumption for coarse dust; no measurement).
* Emission: relative, 0.2 + (u/6)^3 capped at 20 times (assumption: dust lift rises steeply with wind). Snow cover and rain are not modelled at the mine.
* Output scale: the index is a percentage of the strongest pixel more than 3 km from the source in the run. It is not a concentration. CAMS dust and PM10 at the source are shown beside it for context; CAMS is 0.4 degree, so it cannot resolve the mine.
* Households: OpenStreetMap (ger, houses, huts, farmyards, places, and names containing "өвөлжө" or "хаваржаа"), extracted by GitHub Actions into data/settlements.json. Exposed = peak plume index of at least 2 in the run.
* Water: NASA OPERA DSWx surface-water layer (Landsat + Sentinel-2) and OpenStreetMap water polygons.

### Dust types (added 2026-11)
An element does not move dust by itself. The tool follows AERMOD deposition Method 1 and HYSPLIT, which define a particle by diameter and density. Five size bins from the US EPA AP-42 13.2.4 multipliers; Stokes settling with the Cunningham correction; loss from the air at v_g sqrt(2/pi) / sigma_z (Chamberlain source depletion), with Briggs open-country class D sigma_z capped by a 1000 m mixed layer. The index scale is what the air would hold if nothing settled, so a heavy mineral really shows a smaller plume. All types share one size distribution, read as physical sizes: no measured distribution of Mongolian mine dust was found, so real differences may not match. `tests/dust.test.mjs` holds the settling to a separate scipy calculation. The full list of limits is in the methods window of the tool.

Air stability, rain and the mixed layer enter by the hour since 2026-11: the class comes from wind and solar radiation (US EPA-454/R-99-005 Table 6-7), and the spread follows the Briggs open-country curve of that class. The earlier code used the 0.11 coefficient of class C while calling it class D; this is corrected. The ground-level index now falls with the vertical spread, and `tests/physics.test.mjs` holds a steady plume to the analytic Gaussian plume equation. Emission is the AP-42 13.2.4 wind term and stops in rain; precipitation washes dust out with the CALPUFF coefficients. Each run is repeated with the wind turned by 20 degrees and scaled by 20 percent, to show how much the result leans on the wind.

### Mine dust and vegetation (added 2026-11-12)
A second box under the wind and dust model, for coal mines in seasonal grass cover (`VEG_MINES` in `js/config.js`: Baganuur, Sharyn Gol, Nalaikh, Shivee-Ovoo, Khushuut, Mogoin Gol, Aduunchuluun; positions from the Global Energy Monitor coal mine tracker). It reads the dust that settled on the vegetation instead of modelling the air. Dust on leaves lowers the near-infrared reflectance and the NDVI, and falls off with distance from the pit and the haul roads (Ranjan & Parida 2024, J. Environ. Manage. 367; Ma et al. 2020, Remote Sensing 12; Themistocleous & Prodromou 2023, ISPRS Archives XLVIII-1/W2). At one distance from the mine the grass is alike in every direction except for what the wind brings, so `js/minedust_veg.js` compares the mean NDVI of the vegetation of each of 16 wind sectors with the median of the same ring (3–6, 6–10, 10–15, 15–20, 20–30 km) across sectors, on the 100 m domain of the day-by-day model. The deficit under minus max(0.02, 1.5 MAD of the ring), from the inner ring outward without a gap, gives the reach of each sector; a sector with a reach and at least 1/16 of the summer's dust-carrying wind (ERA5 at the mine, hours of 6 m/s or more, weighted by speed, by the sector the wind blows toward) is dusty, a mark without wind or wind without a mark is unclear. The Spearman correlation between wind share and inner-ring deficit is shown as the check of the method for that mine and year. The NDVI comes from the clearest Sentinel-2 L2A passes (at most three, 15 June to 31 August of the chosen year, Planetary Computer data API, gaps filled from passes within 20 days of the clearest one, because steppe NDVI changes through the summer by more than the deficit the method looks for; baseline 04.00 offset removed, SCL cloud, snow and water excluded, NDVI at least 0.20: at Baganuur in July 2025 the steppe east and south of the pit stays under 0.30, so a 0.30 cut would leave the downwind sectors unmeasured). Every 100 m vegetation pixel is also classed by its anomaly (heavily dusted below −0.10, moderately −0.10 to −0.05, lightly −0.05 to −0.02, clean above), shown in the zoomable result window and downloadable as a class raster, polygons, the anomaly and NDVI values, and CSV tables of the sectors, the camps and the hourly wind. The winter and spring camps of `data/camps.bin.gz` are counted two ways: by the class of the vegetation in the 1 km² around each camp (the positions are rounded to about 1 km), and inside the reach of the dusty sectors; the wind of a chosen day and hour highlights its own downwind sector. The contrast is relative (NDVI units, not g/m²): no foliar dust measurement at a Mongolian mine was found to calibrate it, and NDVI also changes with soil, grazing, roads and water. `tests/minedust_veg.test.mjs` holds the sectors, the rose, the ring statistics, the reach, the classes and the camp count to cases worked out by hand. The Ukhaa Khudag satellite study block is hidden since the same day: its result was too weak to show; the files under `docs/uhg/` stay.

**Emission episodes and the report check (added 2026-11-13).** The wind that counts is no longer the whole summer's. Dust leaves the ground only when it is dry and the wind is strong enough, so the box reads hourly wind, precipitation and soil moisture (0–7 cm) from the ERA5 archive at the mine from 15 May to the end of the imagery window and keeps the emission hours: at least 24 h since the end of the last rain of 2 mm or more (24 h sum), soil no wetter than that summer's median, wind of 6 m/s or more; each weighted (u − 6)·u², the shape of a saltation flux. Neighbouring emission hours (gaps of at most 6 h, at least 2 hours) form an emission episode with its own downwind rose. Episodes that start after the image date (the clearest pass, about 11:00 local) cannot show in the image, and episodes followed by rain of 5 mm or more (24 h) before the image date are taken as washed off the leaves; both are listed greyed and unpicked. The rest are picked by default; the panel lets the user pick each episode alone or all together ("Show all together"), and the picked roses are combined by weight. The sector classes, the footprint, the camps inside it and the Spearman check follow the picked rose; each episode also shows its own ρ. Per pixel, a dusted pixel (heavy, moderate, light) outside the picked episodes' downwind sectors becomes class 6, "dusted but not downwind (another cause)", so the camps on mine-dusted vegetation count only the downwind ones. The hourly CSV gains precipitation, soil moisture, hours since rain, emission weight and episode number; an episodes CSV lists each episode with its time, hours, weight, top wind, soil, rain, ρ and whether it is after the image, washed or picked. For a mine with usable public reports (`VEG_REPORTS` in `js/config.js`; Baganuur so far, from the environmental management plans of 2024 and 2026 on eic.mn and the company's 2018 annual report) the panel sets the result against them: whether the ERA5 episodes carry dust toward the report's downwind sectors (prevailing wind from the north-west 26–38 % of the year, north 36 % in July: SE, SSE, S); whether the sectors toward the town, 4.5 km north, at 3–6 km agree with the warm-season dust readings there (mostly within the standard, once 0.264 mg/m³; 0.116–0.281 mg/m³ above it in the cold season); and whether the deficit in the dusty sectors fades from 3–6 km to 10–15 km, as settled dust from the haul roads the mine names as its main source would. The reports give no coordinates for the five dust points, so there is no point-by-point comparison. `tests/minedust_veg.test.mjs` holds the rolling rain, the hours since rain, the soil quantile, the weight gate, the joining and splitting of runs, the washing rule, the combined rose and the pixel attribution to cases worked out by hand.

**Clean and dusty image pair (added 2026-11-13).** At Baganuur in 2025 and 2024 every emission episode before the single clearest image had been washed off by rain, so the single image could not be tied to the mine. The box now looks, among the Sentinel-2 passes of 20 May to 10 September that are at least half clear on the coarse grid, for a pair: a clean image taken after a washing rain (5 mm or more in 24 h) with no emission hour since, and a dusty image taken within 40 days after it, with emission hours between and no washing rain between (`lastWash`, `pairCandidates` in `js/minedust_veg.js`). Pairs are ranked by the emission weight between them times the smaller clear share; the panel lists up to eight. The value mapped is the change of NDVI from the clean to the dusty image (`ndviChange`), on the clean image's vegetation seen clear in both. Growth and drying between the dates are alike in every direction at one distance from the mine, so the ring median removes them; the fall left in the downwind sectors of the episodes between the two images is attributed to the mine, with the same sectors, rings, thresholds, pixel classes and attribution as before. When the summer holds no such pair the single-image method runs, with its washing rule. The result window (`js/aoi/viewer.js`) gains a swipe comparison: the clean image on the left of a line and the dusty one on the right, in true colour or NDVI, the line dragged across the picture, the classes on top at the chosen opacity. **Composites (2026-11-13).** At Baganuur in 2025 the single clean image of the best pair was 73 % cloud in the north sector, the one the episode's wind blew toward, so the result showed a gap exactly downwind. The clean image is taken soon after rain and the clouds of that rain linger. The box therefore builds composites (`pairPlans`, `composite`): for a dusty pass (dust lifted since the last washing rain) every clean pass of the 30 days before it fills the clean picture pixel by pixel, the latest first, and the dusty pass's own clouds are filled from the earlier dusty passes since the same washing rain, the latest first. Plans are ranked by the emission weight since the rain times the share of the coarse grid seen clear in both composites. The panel says which dates fill what share of the 3–30 km pixels. The episodes counted run from the washing rain to the dusty pass, since the dust on the leaves then is everything lifted since the rain. A pixel seen clear in no image is class 7, "cloud (no data)", drawn pale grey by default so that a gap reads as missing data and not as clean or bare ground.

### Surface water (replaced 2026-11)
The OPERA DSWx tiles were removed. They show one day of Landsat and Sentinel-2 and paint "not water" white and cloud grey, so they read as false water. `data/water.geojson` comes from JRC Global Surface Water (`scripts/build_water.py`): a 30 m pixel seen as water in at least half of its clear observations, 1984 to 2021, traced at about 250 m and kept from 0.3 km2 up, 924 bodies. Against published areas: Khövsgöl 2782 km2 (2760), Buir 610 (615), Ögii 25.5 (25), Achit 294 (290), Telmen 208 (194), Uvs 3588 (3350), Khyargas 1527 (1407). Khar-Us gives 970 (1578), because the published figure includes reed beds. It is a long-term map, not the water of the chosen day, and thin rivers are broken or missing.

### Borders (added 2026-11)
No Mongolian standard for boundary line symbols could be found (MNS 6925-5:2021 covers land cover data, not map symbols). The lines keep the order of the USGS Topographic Map Symbols, the higher level heavier, but all three are red at the user's request: the national border solid at 1.8 px with a pale edge, the aimag border solid at 1.35 px with a fainter edge, and the soum border dashed at 1 px, so that aimag and soum lines stay apart where they meet. `scripts/build_borders.py` keeps each stretch of border once, because two dashed copies out of step would look solid. Aimag lines come from merged soums and are a simplified drawing, not an official boundary. Since 2026-11-10 the national border is the outer edge of the same aimags (grown and shrunk by 0.01° to close hairline gaps, simplified to 0.002°). Before, it came from Natural Earth 1:50m, which lay up to several km from the aimag edges: about 920 km of aimag line ran beside the national border as a second red line, now about 76 km, which is where aimag borders meet the national border.

### Winter and spring camps (added 2026-11)
`pipeline/build_camps.py` reads only position and layer from the user's two shapefiles, drops 498 cancelled parcels, rounds to 0.01 degree and merges into counts (`data/camps.bin.gz`). The sources hold phone numbers, clan names, contract numbers and person ids and must never enter this repository. Camps appear only in the mine dust tool, for the dust that reached them, with a range from changing the wind. The two registers may overlap and are not added. The meaning of `pasture_ty` in `points` is not known; all points are treated alike.

### Opening screen and downloads (added 2026-11)
The page opens on the newest true-colour image and nothing else: no risk data is read until a hazard is chosen. `newestImageDate` in `js/gibs.js` takes today if the image already covers Mongolia, otherwise yesterday, because the tile service answers with black until the satellite has passed. Results end on the last computed day, so choosing a hazard moves the picker to that day and says so.

The hazards sit in a bar across the top; crops, pasture and dzud are shown beside them as coming soon. The left panel holds only the settings of the computation of the chosen hazard: it appears when a hazard is picked, folds away whole and comes back from the settings button on the right or by picking the hazard again. Borders, satellite image and sources are in the menu of the top-right button, which opens beside it on the right (2026-11-10). The buttons that filled in a past flood, fire or dust case, and the mine dust example of 2025-06-01, were removed at the user's request on 2026-11-10; the three cases are still the test cases described below (Selenge 2021, Dornod 2019, Ömnögovi 2023-04-10).

The nationwide risk (zones or soums) has a switch under the view modes; when a detailed check finishes it is switched off, so the result is not painted over it, and the switch brings it back. The map stops at zoom 12 (25–40 m a screen pixel), coarser than the 10–60 m of the checks, so each finished check also opens a small window (`js/aoi/viewer.js`) that shows its own pixels: it moves by its title and resizes at its corner, zooms with the wheel or buttons down to single pixels, and gives the latitude and longitude of the four corners in view and the class of the pixel under the pointer (2026-11-11). Behind the result the window lays the clearest Sentinel-2 true-colour pass of the check's own period (`js/aoi/backdrop.js`: the "visual" asset at 10 m, cut to the result grid by the Planetary Computer data API; flood: the optical pass of the check, or 5 days before to 10 days after the radar pass; fire: the post-fire period; dust: the dates of the ground map), fetched only when the window opens; it can be switched off and the result made more or less transparent. When none of the classes switched on occurs in the area, the window names the class that covers most of it instead of staying empty (2026-11-12).

Each hazard has its own colour family (`PALETTES` in `js/config.js`): fire red, flood blue, dust green, combined violet. Every family runs light to dark, checked by `tests/palette.test.mjs`. Each class keeps one solid colour, with a short soft step of 2.5 points at each limit, so that classes stay clearly apart. The classes and their limits are unchanged.

`js/downloads.js` offers each kind of data in the formats that suit it, and lists only what exists at that moment. Without a selection there is the map image and one ZIP for the area on screen; a selection adds its data one by one, and the soum files then hold only the soums touched by the selection. Every download is one ZIP that also holds `<name>_README.txt`: the result, the possible error in points and as a percentage, the long-term trend of a selection, the model check, how to read the fields, and how to open each file in ArcGIS Pro, ENVI, QGIS, Excel or Google Earth. One ZIP is used because a browser may stop a second automatic download, and the text must not get lost. If the browser holds the download back, the menu shows a link to the same file for ten minutes.

The result also travels inside the file, wherever the format has a place for it. A GeoTIFF holds it in the image description and GDAL metadata, with band names and statistics, and has a `.tif.aux.xml` and an ArcGIS `.tif.xml` beside it; a Shapefile has a `.shp.xml`; an image has a `.jpg.aux.xml` or `.png.aux.xml`; GeoJSON has a top-level `metadata` member; KML has a document description; a PDF has title and subject; tables have columns `err_pct`, `area_mean` and `area_U95`; the series has the trend and its limits. The text inside a TIFF is English ASCII, because the format allows no other. A shapefile has no empty number and GIS reads a blank as 0, so missing values there are -9999.

File and field names are plain letters, digits and underscores, with the date as 20261106, because ArcGIS rewrites a hyphen in a name and shapefile fields end at ten characters. A JPG or PNG always comes with its world file, `.prj` and `.aux.xml`: without them ArcGIS puts the picture at 0, 0 with an unknown reference.

`js/formats.js` writes these by hand, as the site has no libraries. `tests/formats.test.mjs` checks them, and the real downloads were read with GDAL/OGR, pyshp and pypdf and opened in ArcGIS 3.4: 448 sampled raster cells equal the CSV, and all 339 soums agree between Shapefile and GeoJSON. Every button of the menu was also run through the everyday steps of ArcGIS Pro 3.4 (Add to a geodatabase, XY Table To Point, JSON To Features, KML To Layer, band names, statistics, metadata), with no failure, and GeoTIFF and Shapefile were read by the IDL 8.5 readers that ENVI 5.3 is built on. ENVI itself has not been opened with these files yet. ArcGIS reads the projection of the image from its `.jpg.aux.xml`, other programs from the `.prj`. U95 in cell and soum files is a lower bound where a part of the error is not estimated, and the files say so.

### Detailed flood mapping in a drawn area (added 2026-11)
The national grid stays at 0.1°. Mapping at 10–30 m runs only for an area the user draws, in a Google Earth Engine App (`gee_app/flood_aoi.js`, published from the Code Editor as `flood-aoi` under project temp-support-478105, because sigma-513109 was not offered in the publishing dialog), which the flood menu opens in a window. The site holds no Earth Engine login; the App draws on that project's noncommercial quota (Community tier, 150 EECU-hours a month since 2026-04-27), apart from the daily update, which uses sigma-513109.

* **Extent**, after the UN-SPIDER Recommended Practice: Sentinel-1 GRD, IW, VH. The last pass before and the first pass after the flood come from one relative orbit, with every frame of each pass. Both are smoothed by a 50 m focal mean, and the after/before ratio of the dB values above 1.25 marks new water. JRC Global Surface Water 1.4 seasonality ≥ 10 months, slopes above 5° on Copernicus DEM GLO-30 (2024_1), and groups of fewer than 8 pixels are removed.
* **Limits of size**: up to 500 km² at 10 m, up to 2,000 km² at 20 m, up to 5,000 km² at 30 m; larger areas are refused. Water depth only up to 500 km².
* **City**: flood pixels on ESA WorldCover v200 built-up land are kept apart and called probabilistic.
* **Optical check**: the clearest Sentinel-2 L2A day within ±3 days of the radar image gives new open water (MNDWI > 0, SCL cloud, shadow and snow removed, permanent water removed). The App shows the share of radar flood it confirms and the share of optical water the radar found.
* **Depth**: FwDET-GEE v2.1 (Peter et al. 2020; Cohen et al. 2022), ported from `FwDET2p1_GEE.txt` with its settings (boundary slope filter 0.5°, 10 smoothing passes, 5-cell kernel), Copernicus DEM in place of NED. FwDET is GPL-2.0, so the folder `gee_app/` is GPL-2.0 and the rest of the site is not.

**Tests (2026-11-08).** Sentinel-1 has no scenes over Ulaanbaatar in 2022 and 2023, so the July 2023 Selbe flood cannot be mapped by radar; Sentinel-2 after it was cloudy (07-01 and 07-03 about 100 %, 07-08 45 %). Floods reported in the news with radar on both sides were used instead, each against the clearest Sentinel-2 day:

| Flood (report) | Radar pair | Sentinel-2 | Radar flood | New water on Sentinel-2 | Radar confirmed | Optical found |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Selenge and Orkhon at Sükhbaatar, above the danger level on 2021-09-06 (ubn.mn) | 2021-08-20 → 09-13, orbit 135 | 2021-09-17 | 24.1 km² | 16.9 km² | 33 % | 47 % |
| Kherlen at Chinggis city, 1,971 homes flooded, July 2020 (FloodList) | 2020-06-23 → 07-05, orbit 91 | 2020-07-05, same day | 1.4 km² | 3.5 km² | 63 % | 25 % |
| Orkhon at Kharkhorin, 5–10 cm above the flood level on 2025-07-14 (Montsame) | 2025-07-07 → 07-19, orbit 55 | 2025-07-23 | 2.6 km² | 1.4 km² | 22 % | 42 % |

Over thresholds from 1.10 to 1.50 the agreement (F1) peaked at 1.25–1.30 for the Selenge (0.39) and at 1.20 for the Kherlen (0.41, 0.36 at 1.25), so the UN-SPIDER default was kept and the App lets the user change it. FwDET depths on the Selenge flood: median 0.12 m, 90th percentile 0.40 m, 99th 0.79 m, plausible for water 5–65 cm above the danger level but not checked against any measurement.

**Computed on the page (added 2026-11-09).** The flood menu now runs the same steps in the browser for the box the user drew or the soum picked (`js/aoi/`), with no Earth Engine and no login; the GEE App stays as a link for water depth. The scenes come from the Microsoft Planetary Computer (free, no account): STAC search finds them, and its data API cuts each one onto the result grid (EPSG:4326, square pixels at the box centre) and sends it as an 8-bit PNG, elevation as 32-bit numbers. Reading the 32-bit radar files directly took over four minutes on the user's line; this takes about 16 s for 355 km² at 10 m and 36 s for 1,900 km² at 20 m. Differences from the App, all from the archives: Sentinel-1 is radiometrically terrain-corrected gamma0 (RTC) instead of sigma0; radar dB arrive in steps of 0.2 dB (−40 to +10 dB); JRC Global Surface Water is version 1.3; the slope is taken on the DEM at 30 m; the clearest Sentinel-2 pass is judged over the whole box instead of the part each image covers; no water depth.

RTC dB were about 2 dB higher than sigma0 over the Selenge box (before −18.3 against −20.3 dB, after −19.7 against −22.1 dB) and changed less, so the ratio rule found less water at 1.25. Thresholds from 1.05 to 1.30 were tried on the three floods against the clearest Sentinel-2 pass (F1 in the clear part, built-up and permanent water left out):

| Threshold | Selenge: radar km² / F1 | Kherlen: radar km² / F1 | Orkhon: radar km² / F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.15 | 42.8 / 0.32 | 2.90 / 0.43 | 4.71 / 0.21 |
| **1.20** | **26.2 / 0.38** | **1.37 / 0.35** | **1.98 / 0.21** |
| 1.25 | 19.1 / 0.38 | 0.74 / 0.25 | 0.95 / 0.14 |
| GEE App at 1.25 | 24.5 / 0.39 | 1.4 / 0.36 | 2.6 / – |

The page uses 1.20: its radar areas are closest to the App's and its agreement with Sentinel-2 is as good. On the Selenge example the page gives 25.97 km² of radar flood outside towns (App 24.54), 0.08 km² in towns (0.06), 17.23 km² of new water on Sentinel-2 (16.85), 31 % of radar flood confirmed (33 %) and 47 % of the optical water found (47 %), in 16 s. Larger boxes are computed at 20 m (up to 2,000 km²) and 30 m (up to 5,000 km²), with the smallest kept group set to about 800 m² at each scale.

A negative test matters as much: after rain on 2018-09-01 near Ulaanbaatar the radar marked 132 km² as new water, of which 94 % was grassland, while a cloud-free Sentinel-2 image two days later showed 2.3 km² of new water and almost no overlap. Haymaking and drying grass lower the radar return the way water does. A darkness rule did not help (those areas were darker than open water). This is why radar flood is shown as confirmed only where Sentinel-2 sees water.

### Burned area and burn severity in a drawn area (added 2026-11)
A second Earth Engine App (`gee_app/fire_aoi.js`, published as `fire-aoi` under temp-support-478105) maps a fire inside an area the user draws, opened from the wildfire menu.

* **Severity**: Sentinel-2 L2A NBR = (B8 − B12)/(B8 + B12), median of cloud-free pixels (SCL cloud, shadow, snow removed; scenes over 70 % cloud left out) before and after the fire. dNBR = NBR before − NBR after, classed by Key and Benson (2006): regrowth below −0.10, unburned −0.10 to 0.10, low 0.10–0.27, moderate-low 0.27–0.44, moderate-high 0.44–0.66, high above 0.66. Burned means dNBR ≥ 0.10. 20 m up to 500 km², 40 m up to 2,000 km², 60 m up to 5,000 km².
* **Comparison**: MODIS MCD64A1 burned area (500 m, monthly) is drawn as an outline and FIRMS active fire as red cells; the App gives the share of Sentinel-2 burned land inside MODIS burned area and the share of MODIS burned area that Sentinel-2 found.
* **Spring fires**: for a fire in March to May the pre-fire image comes from the previous autumn (15 September to 31 October).

**Tests (2026-11-08)**, on the largest MODIS burned patches in Mongolia since 2019, all in Dornod, with areas of about 360–380 km², and on two areas without fire:

| Area | Sentinel-2 burned, pre-fire in March–April | MODIS | F1 | Sentinel-2 burned, pre-fire in previous autumn | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fire, April 2023 (117.5–117.8 E) | 277 km² | 356 km² | 0.86 | 244 km² | 0.80 |
| Fire, May 2023 (115.9–116.2 E) | 162 km² | 249–265 km² | 0.59 | 160 km² | 0.64 |
| Fire, April 2019 (115.6–115.9 E) | 345 km² | 227 km² | 0.79 | 359 km² | 0.77 |
| No fire, April 2023 (113.5–113.8 E) | **140 km²** | 0 | — | 3 km² | — |
| No fire, April 2019 (112.0–112.3 E) | 0 km² | 0 | — | 8 km² | — |

March pre-fire images still held snow and melt water, which made 140 km² of unburned steppe look burned; masking snow by NDSI and subtracting the dNBR of an unburned ring did not cure it, and higher thresholds lost the fires (F1 0.15–0.54 at 0.15–0.20). The autumn baseline cut the false burn to 1–2 % of the area while keeping the agreement with MODIS. MODIS is not ground truth: at 500 m it misses small fires and smooths edges, so the F1 measures agreement, not accuracy. Steppe fires came out almost entirely as low severity (dNBR medians 0.13–0.18).

**Computed on the page (added 2026-11-10).** The wildfire menu now runs the same steps in the browser for the box drawn or the soum picked (`js/aoi/fire.js`), with the fixes made to the App on 2026-11-08 (comparison from the typed pre-fire date, MODIS counted by burn day, a stop when no clear pixel is left). Sentinel-2 L2A, MCD64A1 and active fire come from the Microsoft Planetary Computer through its data API. Differences from the App: each NBR median uses the 4 clearest passes of the period instead of every image (to keep the download small); NBR arrives in steps of 0.008; active fire is MODIS MOD14A1/MYD14A1 (fire classes 7–9, 1 km, Giglio et al. 2016) instead of FIRMS, whose API needs a key that cannot sit in a public page. Monthly MCD64A1 files are joined with "or": a first version filled only gaps and let a month without burns hide the next month's burns (0.86 km² instead of 227 km² in the example).

On the April 2019 example (autumn pre-fire image) the page gives 357.1 km² burned (App 358.9), MODIS 227.2 km² (227.3), 63 % of the Sentinel-2 burn inside MODIS and 100 % of MODIS found (both as the App), low severity 326.3 km² and moderate-low 30.8 km² (App 317.3 and 41.6: the median of 4 passes instead of all images moves part of the burn between these two classes), and 2.8 km² of 1 km cells with MODIS active fire (FIRMS 2.2 km²).

The other test areas, all with the autumn pre-fire image (App values from the table above):

| Area | Sentinel-2 burned: page / App | MODIS: page / App | F1: page / App |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire, April 2023 (117.5–117.8 E) | 223 / 244 km² | 356 / 356 km² | 0.76 / 0.80 |
| Fire, May 2023 (115.9–116.2 E) | 153 / 160 km² | 250 / 249–265 km² | 0.60 / 0.64 |
| No fire, April 2023 (113.5–113.8 E) | 2.0 / 3 km² | 0 / 0 | — |
| No fire, April 2019 (112.0–112.3 E) | 1.6 / 8 km² | 0 / 0 | — |

The page finds a little less burned land than the App (the median of 4 passes is stricter than the median of all images) and fewer false burns. The April 2023 fire lies in MODIS tile h26v04, whose footprint in the Planetary Computer's catalogue is wrong, so a box search missed it; MODIS files are now looked up by tile number (`searchModis` in `js/aoi/stac.js`).

### Satellite check of dust over a drawn area (added 2026-11)
A third Earth Engine App (`gee_app/dust_aoi.js`, published as `dust-aoi` under temp-support-478105) sits beside the mine tool in the dust menu. All three sources are coarse, so it works on areas up to 300,000 km² and does not map at 10–30 m.

* **TROPOMI**: Sentinel-5P absorbing aerosol index of the day (OFFL, NRTI while OFFL is not out); above 1 marks absorbing aerosol, dust or smoke.
* **CAMS**: global near-real-time dust aerosol optical depth at 550 nm, mean of 03–10 UTC from the 00 UTC run. The dust band exists only from 2021-06-24; earlier days show the total aerosol optical depth and do not count as a dust vote.
* **MODIS**: Aqua MYD09CMG brightness temperature difference BT31 − BT32 (0.05°), pixels colder than 250 K left out as cloud tops; below −0.5 K marks possible dust (Ackerman 1997).
* A source counts as seeing dust when at least 30 % of the area passes its level (CAMS: maximum ≥ 0.1). The App reports how many agree, never lets the BTD decide alone, and shows FIRMS fires because the aerosol index cannot tell smoke from dust. It also draws a time series of up to 60 days of area means of the AAI and CAMS AOD.

**Tests (2026-11-08)** over the southern Gobi (103.5–105.5 E, 42.8–44.2 N) and central Mongolia (105–107.5 E, 46.5–48.2 N):

| Day | Area | AAI > 1 | BTD < −0.5 K | CAMS AOD |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2023-03-21, dust storm | Gobi | 100 % (mean 3.3) | 100 % | 0.07 (dust) |
| 2023-04-10, dust storm | Gobi | 100 % (mean 3.1) | 97 % | 0.18 (dust) |
| 2023-04-11 | Gobi | 32 % | 100 % | 0.02 (dust) |
| 2021-03-14 and 15, dust storm | Gobi | 0 % | 0 % (14th: 1 % of the area clear of cold cloud) and 24 % | 0.29 and 0.09 (total AOD) |
| 2021-03-10, calm | Gobi | 0 % | **96 %** | 0.18 (total AOD) |
| 2021-07-20, calm | Gobi | 0 % | 0 % | 0.09 (dust) |

On the two 2023 storms the aerosol index and the BTD agreed fully. The great storm of 14–15 March 2021 was not seen at the early-afternoon overpass: on the 14th the whole area was under cold cloud tops, and the aerosol index stayed negative. On a calm, clear spring day the BTD was below −0.5 K over 96 % of the Gobi, because bare desert emits less in band 31 than in band 32; this is why it never decides alone. CAMS dust AOD stayed below 0.2 on storm days, far under what such storms usually reach, so its values are kept as a model hint.

### Dust check computed on the page (added 2026-11-10)
The dust menu now checks a box drawn on the map (or a soum picked) in the browser (`js/aoi/dust.js`), for the day of the day picker. It reports what was measured and adds no new score; the GEE App stays as a link for whether dust was seen, because TROPOMI files (tens to over 100 MB each) are too large to read in a browser.

* **Ground**: the clearest Sentinel-2 L2A passes of the 30 days up to the day (Microsoft Planetary Computer, cut by its data API), up to three, the later ones filling only cloud. Scene class 11 is snow, 6 water, 3 and 8–10 cloud and shadow; the rest is sorted by NDVI (harmonized for processing baseline 04.00): below 0.15 bare soil and sand, 0.15–0.30 sparse vegetation, above that vegetation. 20 m up to 2,000 km², 60 m up to 20,000 km². The NDVI limits are common conventions, not fitted to Mongolian dust events.
* **Weather**: Open-Meteo hourly wind at 10 m, gusts, precipitation, snow depth and topsoil moisture (0–7 cm) at nine points (the centres of a 3 × 3 split of the box) for the day and the two after it: forecast within 85 days, ERA5 before. Hours are counted when the mean wind of the nine points is at least 6, 10 or 14 m/s on a day without rain (≥ 0.254 mm, US EPA AP-42 13.2.2) and without snow (≥ 1 cm), the same onset and rules as the national dust score. CAMS dust near the ground (Open-Meteo air quality) is reported with the WHO 24-hour PM10 guideline of 45 µg/m³ as a reference level.
* **Conclusion**: no conditions when the ground is snow-covered, bare ground is under 5 % of the clear part, or the wind stayed below 6 m/s on dry hours; otherwise "some dust may rise", "conditions met" (≥ 10 m/s) or "met, with a storm" (≥ 14 m/s). When CAMS is above 45 µg/m³ but there are no local conditions, the page says so apart: the dust may come from elsewhere or the model may be wrong.

**Tests (2026-11-10)**, box 104–105 E, 43–44 N (8,989 km², 60 m):

| Day (seen by the GEE App's TROPOMI test) | Bare ground | Hours ≥ 6 / ≥ 10 m/s | Highest wind / gust | CAMS dust | Conclusion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2023-03-21, dust storm (AAI > 1 on 100 %) | 95 % | 18 / 7 | 13.3 / 26.7 m/s | 1,276 µg/m³ | conditions met |
| 2023-04-10, dust storm (AAI > 1 on 100 %) | 97 % | 39 / 10 | 11.8 / 25.0 m/s | 835 µg/m³ | conditions met |
| 2021-03-14, dust storm (under cloud at the overpass) | 98 % | 20 / 12 | 12.4 / 29.5 m/s | no data | conditions met |
| 2021-03-10, calm (AAI 0 %) | 98 % | 0 / 0 | 5.7 / 14.4 m/s | no data | no conditions (calm) |
| 2021-07-20, calm (AAI 0 %) | 96 % | 18 / 0 | 8.0 / 19.7 m/s | no data | **some dust may rise** |
| 2023-07-20, rain on 2 of 3 days | 97 % | 0 / 0 | 6.4 / 16.9 m/s | 581 µg/m³ | no conditions here; CAMS shows dust |

All three storms were flagged, including 2021-03-14, which TROPOMI missed under cloud. The calm day of 2021-03-10, on which the MODIS split-window test of the GEE App marked 96 % of the area as dust, is correctly not flagged. The calm summer day of 2021-07-20 is a false alarm at the lowest level: 18 hours just above 6 m/s on bare ground raised no dust that TROPOMI could see. Wind above 6 m/s is a condition, not a sign, of dust; six days are far too few to give a hit rate.

### GIS files of the detailed checks (added 2026-11-10)
After a flood, wildfire or dust check has run on the page, the download menu shows its row first: it is the finest result the page has. `js/aoi/files.js` turns the check's own pixels into files, with nothing resampled, so the files hold what the map shows.

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `*_classes.tif` (+ `.tif.aux.xml`, `.tfw`, `.prj`, `.tif.xml`) | One byte per pixel, the class code, with its colours inside the TIFF and a class table (name in Mongolian and English, area in km², colour) in the `.aux.xml`, which ArcGIS Pro and QGIS read as the legend. EPSG:4326. |
| `*_values.tif` | Float bands where the check has values: flood permanent water and Sentinel-2 new water; fire dNBR, MODIS burned area and MODIS active fire. −9999 = no data. |
| `*_polygons.shp` / `.geojson` / `.kml` | One multipart polygon per class, with `area_km2`, `share_pct`, `n_poly`, `small_km2`, `period`, `px_m`. |
| `*.kmz` | The class picture laid over the ground in Google Earth. |
| `*_map.png` (+ `.pgw`, `.prj`, `.aux.xml`) | The same picture, placed in EPSG:4326. |

Polygons follow the pixel edges exactly, as gdal_polygonize does (`js/aoi/vector.js`). Pixels of a class that share an edge form one polygon; pixels touching only at a corner are joined there only when they already belong to the same polygon, so no ring passes a point twice and every polygon is valid in GEOS and ArcGIS (`tests/vector.test.mjs`). Groups smaller than about 1,000 m² (10 pixels at 10 m, 3 at 20 m, 1 at 30 m and coarser) are left out of the polygon files to keep them small; their area is reported in `small_km2` and the rasters keep every pixel.

Each ZIP has a README with the period, area, pixel size, the result lines of the check, the area of every class and the possible error as far as it is known: the comparison with the GEE App, the per-run check against a second source (Sentinel-2 for flood, MODIS for fire), the area left without a result under cloud, and the one-pixel uncertainty of edges.

Checked on the three examples with GDAL 3 (ArcGIS Pro Python) and arcpy 3.4: the class tables equal the pixel areas and the numbers of the side menu (flood 17.81 + 8.16 = 25.97 km², fire 326.28 + 30.82 + 0.004 = 357.1 km²); every polygon is valid in OGR and in Check Geometry (the only note is the missing optional spatial index); the ellipsoidal area of the polygons is within 0.3 % of `area_km2 − small_km2`; all files load into a file geodatabase, JSON To Features and KML To Layer work, and the PNG lands at its place. Sizes: flood (355 km², 10 m) 37 MB for everything, of which 28 MB the float raster; fire (366 km², 20 m) 21 MB; dust (8,989 km², 60 m) 34 MB.

### Mine dust day by day (added 2026-11-12)
The mine dust tool has a "day by day" part (`js/minedaily.js`, `js/minedailybox.js`) that maps the dust of the mine alone for each day of a period of 7, 14 or 31 days. Satellites see all the aerosol together, so the mine's share is separated by transport: the puff model of `js/plume.js`, now able to release from an area, is run with

- the release spread over 12 points inside the pit outline (OpenStreetMap quarry of Ukhaa Khudag, from the study in `docs/uhg/quarries.geojson`; other mines a 1.5 km circle around their point);
- hourly 10 m wind from ECMWF IFS at about 9 km on 7 × 7 nodes 0.1° apart (Open-Meteo archive, then its forecast service for the last days; ERA5 at about 25 km only if neither has data — Open-Meteo's ERA5-Land has no 10 m wind or rain, so it is not used), with the stability and mixing height of the hour;
- an hourly emission: haulage and loading by the AP-42 13.2.4 wind term whenever the ground is dry and free of snow, plus wind erosion above 6 m/s (the onset used across the site) growing with the cube of the wind from zero at the onset; rain of 0.254 mm in the hour (AP-42 13.2.2), topsoil water of 0.25 m³/m³ or more, or 1 cm of snow stop it. The weights of the two terms are an assumption: the real emission of the mine is not public;
- 5-minute steps, an 8-hour spin-up before each day, puffs kept up to 8 hours and dropped once well outside the domain.

Each day is the mean ground-level index of 48 half-hour snapshots on a 100 m grid 30 km around the mine, on one scale for the period (100 = the strongest daily value more than 3 km from the pit). The panel gives the direction (index-weighted centre beyond 3 km), the farthest reach and area at 5 % or more, the strongest value, the hours of emission and of wind erosion, a Sentinel-2 true-colour image of the day where a pass exists, a GeoTIFF of the day and a CSV of the days. A 31-day period took about 30 s in the browser.

Check against the Ukhaa Khudag study (`docs/uhg/daily.csv`, 36 paired June days of 2023–2025): the daily direction was within 45° of the midday wind bearing on 32 days (median 13°), which mostly shows that both use the same wind. The amount was not confirmed: Spearman ρ between the modelled area at 5 % and the downwind − upwind MAIAC AOD difference was −0.34 (bootstrap 95 %: −0.60 to −0.02), −0.24 for the strongest value (−0.56 to +0.10); without the wind-erosion term −0.25 (−0.54 to +0.09) and −0.09 (−0.46 to +0.26); the midday wind speed alone gives +0.05. A 1 km column AOD contrast of about +0.01 is too small and too mixed with regional dust to test a ground-level plume day by day, so the tool says where the dust goes and how far, and treats how much as a comparison only.

### Mine location conflict
The coordinates in the user's own Earth Engine script (43.6668 N, 105.5181 E) are the **Ukhaa Khudag** mine in Tsogttsetsii soum, **Ömnögovi** province (Wikipedia gives 43.6754 N, 105.5211 E, about 0.9 km away). They are not in Dornogovi. Mines that are in Dornogovi (Bayanshand/Dovtsog Khudag, Mandakh; Eldev, Dalanjargalan) are also offered. Which Dornogovi mine is the largest was not established from the sources found; the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority of Mongolia is the body that holds production figures.
* Wind-direction uncertainty: hourly model winds are often 10 to 30 degrees off the true local direction, and a single steady direction gives a plume far narrower than reality. The tool therefore adds an angular spread (default 10 degrees, selectable 0/10/20) to the Briggs width in quadrature, x tan(angle). This is a worst-case style envelope, not a fitted value; 0 degrees reproduces the pure Briggs plume.
